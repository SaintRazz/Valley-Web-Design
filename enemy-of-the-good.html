    The Enemy of the Good<br>
    <br>
    The French writer Voltaire once asserted that "The perfect is the
    enemy of the good". This is an interesting concept, though not
    necessarily a new one, even for the time. Chinese philosopher
    Confucious advised "better a diamond with flaw than a pebble
    without" and legendary playwright William Shakespeare wrote
    "striving to better, we oft mar what's well". But, what does it
    mean?<br>
    <br>
    The idea instantly seems to be an oxymoron because we all regard
    perfect as being superior to merely good. But, good seems far more
    quantifiable. Good implies something that is functional, that gets
    the job done . . . whatever that job may be. Perfect is a bit more
    ephemeral. At what point is something perfect? A machine that
    consumes raw material and ejects widgets is good, if the the
    produced widgets have a market value greater than all the input
    material (and energy, labor, etc.). But, what would a "perfect"
    machine be? One that produces no waste? One that produces the
    widgets instantly? That requires no energy or labor inputs? If every
    factory has labor-less machines, whose wages are even buying the
    product?<br>
    <br>
    These are thorny questions and reasonable people can often quickly
    shun the perfect and choose to define "good" as "good enough". There
    is even a concept in management theory called Analysis Paralysis,
    which describes the inability to chose an option because of ever
    greater attention paid to every minute detail of the selections
    available. The irony, of course, is that such rigor is necessitated
    by the importance of the decision, but the decision made too late
    (or not at all), results in even greater harm or loss than the "bad"
    choice would have.<br>
    <br>
    And what, you may ask, has all this to do with web design? Well,
    when choosing an option for a web designer, it is important to scale
    cost and service appropriately for the endeavor. One extreme of this
    was addressed in the article Do It Yourself. Therein, I explained
    that web design was a skill well within the means of most people to
    acquire, if they choose, but that sometimes it is more productive to
    outsource that function. However, it is possible to go too far in
    the idea that web designers are worth whatever they are paid. <br>
    <br>
    This is not to say that I deny the skills of a designer charging
    $80, $100, or even more for an hour's labor. The product they
    provide may absolutely be worth that, in terms of the technical
    skill required to produce it or the performance of the code.
    Nonetheless, it may still not be appropriate for your needs. Let's
    say you are a baker and need a more tangible asset, like a truck to
    deliver your bread. A 25' long step-van might be just the ticket.
    But, if you analyze the capacity, cost, and fuel efficiency of a
    tractor-trailer rig, it is indisputably superior. Or is it?<br>
    <br>
    The issue here is unused capacity. If you can fill that 80' long
    tractor-trailer with your delicious baked goods on the regular, you
    will pay less for each loaf thus moved. However, if you can't, then
    there are a lot of costs that will remain the same, even if the
    trailer is only half-full of product. Not the least of these is the
    cost of the truck itself and the wage of the driver. Needless to
    say, buying and operating a 25' step-van takes less money and skill
    than an 80' tractor-trailer rig.<br>
    <br>
    A similar dynamic is at work with websites. Though your particular
    needs may require a professional designer, they may not necessarily
    indicate the services of a premier design firm, with all the
    attendant costs. I can assure you that you can find design firms
    that will make you a site twice as good as I can and it may only
    cost you ten times a much! Let's talk.<br>
