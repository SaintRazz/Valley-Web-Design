    Can't I do this myself?<br>
    <br>
    That is, of course a valid question. It's even an astute one. You
    might be surprised to hear a web designer answer with an emphatic
    "YES". Most people absolutely can design and publish their own
    websites. But, don't get so wrapped up in the question of whether
    you "can" that you forget to question whether you "should" (thanks,
    Dr. Malcolm).<br>
    <br>
    There are many parts to a good website. Firstly, the text content
    has to be clear, grammatically correct, and accurate (or
    entertaining, depending upon your purpose). Technology and search
    rankings mean little if you aren't communicating effectively. This
    part is easy for academics, writers, and intellectuals, since ideas
    and language are the tools of their trade. But, people whose skills
    lie in other quarters may have to invest a lot of time and effort
    into this facet of the page.<br>
    <br>
    The other, major aspect of web site design is technology. I won't
    say that it is the greater of the two, considering that it is mostly
    the mechanism by which the ideas of the content are expressed. If
    there is no content, there is nothing to express. Two sides of the
    same coin, as it were. However, the technological side is nearly
    always the more challenging of the two, because most everyone who
    wants to publish a website wants to publish in a language they have
    been speaking since they were a small child. They seldom have nearly
    as much experience with the technology. So, right now, let's break
    down the tech.<br>
    <br>
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The entire internet runs
    on HTML and it controls the display of content. If words or passages
    should be displayed in another font, color, size, position, or
    virtually any other manner, it is HTML that will determine how this
    is accomplished. The barrier to entry for learning HTML is pretty
    low. Many resources are free on the internet to learn it. It isn't
    nearly as complex as programming languages (a Markup Language is
    distinct from a programming language, though I won't get into the
    weeds with why . . . at least for now). And once learned, like any
    skill, frequent use will maintain and grow one's knowledge of it.
    But, this investment isn't insubstantial. But, you can do it
    yourself.<br>
    <br>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is often used in
    conjunction with HTML to alter how pages display. The most common
    use of CSS is to provide a template for how a page is displayed,
    which can then be applied to multiple pages. Let's say you write a
    series of articles and want the title, body, and notes to all be
    formatted a certain way. You also want every article to have the
    same formatting for these elements. You can code all of these
    requirements in the each article you write, of course, using only
    HTML. However, by using CSS, you can create a style sheet that will
    apply these elements to any page that cites the CSS document as the
    source of its formatting. This can reduce the time it takes to
    produce such content, as you don't have to code that information
    into each one and it can also minimize the chance of errors, as the
    CSS will be entirely consistent between such documents. CSS isn't
    much more complex than HTML, if any. So isn't harder to learn, but
    to use it, it would have to be learned in addition to HTML.<br>
    <br>
    JavaScript is an actual programming language. JavaScript was
    designed to work in close conjunction with HTML. JavaScript can even
    be coded directly into a web page to perform simple functions.
    Because JavaScript is a bona fide programming language, it can
    receive input, perform computations, interface with other documents
    or databases, and output data. It can also alter HTML, changing the
    way a page is displayed. The relationship between HTML, CCC, and
    JavaScript has been described as a trinity of technologies that
    support the internet, HTML controlling content, CSS determining how
    content is displayed, and JavaScript controlling the behavior of
    websites. JavaScript is much more complicated than HTML and CSS.<br>
    <br>
    Once all this is taken care of and you website looks and acts just
    like you want it to, you should consider that how the site looks to
    YOU isn't really the important part. How (and if) other people see
    the page is more important. How they see it is going to depend on
    what type of device they view it on. Apples, PCs, Smartphones all
    interpret and display web pages differently and you may have to make
    adjustments to the code to ensure that the site looks good on a
    variety of platforms.<br>
    <br>
    Accessibility can mean more that different devices, though. Some
    people are visually or hearing impaired and are assisted by
    screen-readers or other technology. For your site to integrate with
    these and allow a positive experience for such visitors will require
    code not visible on the website, as viewed by an unaugmented
    browser. Alternate text identifies images when they can't be
    displayed or seen. Division and navigation tags assist screen
    readers in moving around a site. Code in header, head, and title
    sections may not be visible to a user, but can help users
    (differently-abled or not) locate the pages.<br>
    <br>
    While this seems like a lot, we haven't even discussed search engine
    optimization, social media, interfaces for monetary transactions,
    message boards, and email systems. You may not need all of these,
    but any you would need may offer a substantial learning curve. If
    you are a reasonably intelligent and persistent individual, you can
    absolutely do it yourself. But, it is valid to question whether
    doing so is most productive. After all, what else could you have
    accomplished in the time it takes to learn, practice, and perform
    all of the above? The fact that you were doing web-design, instead
    of running your restaurant, writing your next novel, formulating a
    campaign strategy, or whatever else means that you have taken time
    and energy away from that endeavor. Economists call the fact that to
    do "A", you must necessarily forgo doing "B" (and reaping whatever
    advantages B could offer) "opportunity cost". <br>
    <br>
    In many circumstances, the opportunity cost of self-design and
    publishing of a site is far higher than the savings that can be
    realized by keeping all such functions "in-house". If you'd like to
    discuss this further, I'd be more than happy to speak with you!<br>
