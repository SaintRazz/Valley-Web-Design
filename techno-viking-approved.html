    What Can Techno Viking Teach Us About Web Design?<br>
    <br>
    In 2000, an innocuous scene at a Berlin music festival gave rise to
    a viral sensation. An artist/videographer named Matthias Fritsch
    took about four minutes of footage that was initially labeled
    "Kneecam No. 1". A young woman with blue hair was dancing in the
    street when a man ran or stumbled into her in a manner that was, at
    least reckless, and possibly rude or creepy. Another man in the
    vicinity seemed to be bothered by this interaction and briefly
    detained the individual, conversing with him shortly before sending
    him on his way with an intimidating glare and pointed finger.<br>
    <br>
    The video floated around the internet for a while and is still
    easily found, though I won't link it (for reasons that will soon be
    obvious). The footage likely became popular for a few reasons. The
    distinctive look of the man who intervened was surely one. He was a
    fair-skinned, blond, muscular, shirtless man, wearing a Mjolnir
    pendant and braids in his long beard. He looked like nothing more
    than a viking. The footage also has a soundtrack built in, being a
    music festival. Surely the juxtaposition of the electronic, modern
    music and the primal, archaic "viking" added to the appeal and led
    to the moniker "Techno Viking". There may also have been an element
    of poetic justice of the clumsy or lecherous man getting his
    comeuppance via the actions of the Techo Viking. In any case, the
    scene has been shared on various websites hundreds of millions of
    times and Fritch created a Techo Viking archive, achieved some
    degree of fame, and has given numerous, paid speaking engagements on
    the topic.<br>
    <br>
    As interesting as all this may be, what has it got to do with your
    website? And why won't I link the video? Because the use of people's
    images, especially without their permission and for activities that
    generate income, is a very complicated issue and in 2013 Techno
    Viking, the real person, not the idea, meme, or celebrity, filed a
    legal suit against Matthias Fritsch. He asserted that he did not
    give permission to anyone to use his image and that he was not a
    public figure and did not wish to become one. He won and the
    judgement of 23,000 Euros more than eclipsed what Fritsch had earned
    from the footage.<br>
    <br>
    Fritsch says that he attempted to find and contact Techno Viking,
    whose real name is known to some, but not the general public. But,
    he didn't succeed in doing so and did profit from the footage for
    some years before the suit was filed. Nor was he the only person who
    distributed the footage or created and/or profited from works
    derived from it. The outcome for Fritsch might well have been very
    different if he made a disclaimer that the footage was not be used
    for commercial purposes without permission from the people depicted
    therein, or if he had declined to monetize it himself. But, this
    cannot be known for certain, even for people who are experts in
    matters like intellectual property and media law. Sometimes it comes
    down to the court's decision.<br>
    <br>
    However, going into a situation with as much expertise and
    experience as you can is always advisable. If the story of Techno
    Viking has a definitive moral, it is "do not assume that anything
    you see published online is free to use for your own purposes".
    There is an incredible variety and quantity of resources available
    for use on your website that can be used free of charge and risk.
    Public domain works of art and literature produced long ago can be
    used freely. Open source properties can be used free of cost, but
    may be subject to limitations on use. For example, you may be able
    to use a particular piece of software for free, but not modify it or
    charge someone else for access to it. Public figures images or work
    may be used for satirical, critique, or reporting purposes, though
    there are limits on this as well.<br>
    <br>
    And THAT'S why I'm not linking to the Techno Viking video I just
    watched a few minutes ago. Because, this website is part of my web
    design business and if I use this man's image as part of a
    commercial endeavor, I am exposing myself to legal risk, showing my
    potential or current clients that I will play loosely with the rules
    when it comes to sites I design, and it IS just wrong to use a
    private citizen's image without their permission. <br>
    <br>
    Most of what I learned about the rules governing the use of
    intellectual property, I learned at University, where I attained a
    Bachelors of Science in Finance with a focus in Economics at a
    AACSB-accredited business school. If you have any questions about
    how these issues impact your website, I'd be happy to chat with you
    about it.<br>
