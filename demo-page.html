    What can a webpage do?<br>
    <br>
    Text: As the word "page" suggests, a webpage can display text. Pages
    can also feature links to other pages. Much of web design consists
    of displaying text much as a hard copy book would. Web pages can
    feature text in different sizes, colors, fonts, background color,
    opacity, and positioning. However, this is not the end of what it
    can do, but the beginning.<br>
    <br>
    Two-way flow of information: A book allows information to flow in
    only one direction. In technical parlance, this is labeled
    "simplex". While books can be wonderful entertainment and tools for
    learning, a book is only sending information. The book itself cannot
    receive data. Websites, on the other hand, can collect information
    from those visiting them. "Form" is the technical name for the HTML
    structures that illicit information from visitors. These can take
    various . . . um . . . forms. Some can take a simple query about a
    visitor's preference to display the page in a particular way. Others
    might send information to a database administering a newsletter.
    But, the point is that, unlike a newspaper ad or flyer, the website
    creates a more interactive relationship with one's intended
    audience.<br>
    <br>
    Accessibility: While most of your site's visitors will read your
    page in the form of text, some will not be able to. But, as strange
    as it may seem, given how largely visual the Internet is, it has
    proven an incredible resource for the blind. Internet screen readers
    are utilities that scan web pages and output the text in audio form.
    Screen readers can also describe images, links, and other media
    displayed on the page. <br>
    <br>
    Multi-media: Beyond mere text, websites can also display static or
    moving images, play sound and music, and allow two-way communication
    between users with a delay or in real-time. <br>
    <br>
    Social Media: As a cultural, economic, and technological outgrowth
    of the fact that the Internet can disseminate AND collect
    information, social media have been developed. Applications like
    Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and others can powerfully
    augment the effectiveness of your website. Political organizations,
    cultural endeavors, businesses, and other entities can find these
    platforms to be effective at leveraging their efforts. <br>
    <br>
    Search Engine Optimization: Having a memorable website address can
    be a great way to ensure that people who have heard of your site or
    visited it before can find it when they look for it. However, the
    truth is that many people looking for your site may not know that
    it, or something like it, even exists. They will use search engines,
    like Google or Bing, to locate it. The process of designing a
    website so that search engines locate it and rank it as highly as
    possible in their results is called "search engine optimization" or
    "SEO". SEO uses various mechanisms<br>
