    What’s In A Domain?<br>
    <br>
    We all know that first impressions matter. In cyberspace, one of the
    most important first impressions is that incited by a domain name.
    Finding out more about the technical aspects of domain names is
    easy, but in this article, I’m addressing the response of people to
    domain names in two of the most common<br>
    places they are found. In website addresses and email addresses.<br>
    <br>
    Establishing an online presence is easy and for many purposes free.
    It costs nothing to get an account on Facebook or Youtube.com and
    many services offer email, blog publishing, or data storage for
    free. This is well known to people who are even marginally
    technologically literate. So we must consider what<br>
    people will think when they see a web address or email address with
    which we are associated. That’s not to say you should be ashamed of
    a free email account. In fact, I have a few. In fact, a free email
    account that you rarely use can come in quite handy. Free trials for
    products or services, correspondence with certain businesses, even
    job hunting can result in a deluge of spam emails that you would
    rather not have to deal with hitting your “main” email account. And
    there’s certainly nothing wrong with using a free account for normal
    email usage and correspondence. In similar manner, blog hosting,
    personal information pages and other kinds of web pages or sites can
    get the job done in an unostentatious way.<br>
    <br>
    However, sometimes the stakes are a bit higher. If you are trying to
    build a business, reputation, following, or otherwise striving to be
    taken seriously in your endeavor, a custom domain name may be just
    the thing. Take for example Joe Snuffy the Bagman. He might have
    been blogging for years on the virtues of cloth containers using a
    Blogger page and his clients can reach him at
    jsnuffybagman@gmail.com. Now there is nothing wrong with this if
    that is what he prefers. But, if he is serious about expanding his
    business, he should consider how people might react to
    joesbagemporium.com or joe@bagman.com. These distinctions show that
    Joe has taken initiative to carve out a more distinctive niche in
    cyberspace for his cause and people will know that this took money,
    effort, and technical expertise. Who would you trust to meet your
    needs for flexible, thin-walled containers? The guy who spend ten
    minutes making a <br>
    free email account and blogging on a free platform or the guy who
    was smart enough to build a website from the ground up (or
    successful enough to hire tech guys to do it)?<br>
    <br>
    The truth is that the financial and technical barriers to having
    your own domain name for websites and emails is lower that a lot of
    people think. So, Joe is benefiting from a lot of adulation that
    might not be fully deserved. But, most people who start up a
    business aren’t worried about deserving such respect,<br>
    they are more than willing to work for it. They are trying to get
    such respect in the first place. Having a unique domain, instead of
    one that is ubiquitous and widely recognized as free, can be a
    subtle, but real way to augment this.<br>
    <br>
    Of course, tech-savvy people will not be impressed by what they know
    is quite easy to acquire. But, this places the shoe on the other
    foot. In this case, how much more amateurish does one look for not
    having a custom domain name, when it is so easily acquired? Needless
    to say, I can assist with this, and look forward to hearing from
    you!<br>
